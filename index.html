        <h1> Headers again, because my notes failed to save last time.</h1>
        <h2> so many headers</h2>
        <h3>Need to make room for other things.</h3>
        <h4> Too many headers. Not sure which ones I'll end up using as often as others. </h4>
        <h5>The bigger the number, the smaller the header text. weird. </h5>

        <p> Writing a <i>Paragraph</i> now, with a small sample of the italicize code.</br>
          Also broke into a new line for the paragraph with the <u>BR</u> tag or whatever it's called.
         </br> Just a few reminders of basic font manipulation I guess.</p>

          <ul> Using the UL (Unordered List) tag, the line will indent a bit, and when paired with an LI tag for children...
            <li> It creates bullet points. Pretty useful!
          </ul>
          <ol> Now, if I use the OL (Ordered List) tag, it will indent the same way, but...
            <li> Instead of bullet points, the children LI tags will create <I><u> numbered</u></i> lists.
            <li>Pretty neat!
          </ol>
      </div>

          <p>It seems that the basic format for beginner code is built like this: </br>
            < !DOCTYPE html> </br>
            < html></br>
            < head></br></br>
            < /head> </br>
            < body></br></br>
            < /body></br>
            < /html> </br>
            Minus all the spaces following the alligator clip or whatever their called lol.</br></br>
             Here is a a whole image tag. Built like this ( <b>< img src="enter URL here"/></b>)

            <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTKZbhEW6HivT5DtObd1fLopq9KOCxA99Ki7Q&usqp=CAU"/>
       </div>    

       <div class="footer">
